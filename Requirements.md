Electronic Health Record:

**USER STORY:**

A worker goes to her primary care clinic for follow-up about her type II diabetes. Despite taking her medication as directed, her diabetes is poorly controlled, with a hemoglobin A1C of 9.5. She had recently entered information into her patient portal about her work as a medical assistant at a local hospital working the night shift. This information, including current employment status, industry, occupation, and work schedule was recorded into the electronic health record (EHR). When the nursing staff enters the reason for the clinic visit into the EHR field for chief complaint, this information triggers a pop up box that states that shift work can affect diabetes control and provides recommendations on diabetes management among shift workers. This clinical decision support tool allows the providers to adjust the patient’s medication and provide educational resources to improve the patient’s health.
